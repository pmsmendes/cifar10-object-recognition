# CIFAR-10 Object Recognition
This project implements and evaluates two deep learning models: VGG-16 and ResNet-34 on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
It is a more educational deep learning project - it starts by preprocessing the data, followed by training and evaluation of the models. Performance is measured with traditional metrics and data visualization techniques.
